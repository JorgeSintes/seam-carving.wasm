# seam-carving.wasm
The idea is to create a minimal webUI that lets us take/use a picture and run the seam-carving algorithm on 
it, selecting the axis to shrink and by how much. 

- The algorithm implementation will be done in C, compiled to WASM. 
- The frontend will likely be built in Vue and tailwind.
